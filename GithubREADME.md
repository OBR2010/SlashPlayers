Hello everyone,
this is a short and simple script for those who need a /players command for TX ADMIN Moderators and above, this command will display all 
users in the current server, however if you have more than 20 I recomend using it in the console instead as it will clog up your chatbox 
and will be hard to read, I will be making a addition to this where you can get information on someone with there ID, stay tuned!
